Grappling Hook
==============

My first SWEP for Garrysmod, a simple grappling hook.

Controls
--------
- <b>Left Mouse Button:</b> Shoot the hook.
- <b>Reload:</b> Brings the hook back in and reloads the grappling hook.

### Once the hook attaches...
- <b>Right Mouse Button:</b> Reel yourself in towards the hook.
- <b>Jump:</b> If you're close enough to the hook, you can release it and give yourself a boost upwards.
- <b>Use:</b> Increases the length of the rope and allows you to rappel yourself downwards
- <b>Reload:</b> Releases the hook and reloads the grappling hook.

### When the grappling hook is holstered...
You can still swing around, reel in, and rappel yourself when you switch to a different weapon after the hook attaches to a surface.
Some controls however do switch around slightly:
- <b>Sprint Key:</b> Reel yourself in towards the hook.
- <b>Crouch:</b> Releases the hook and reloads the grappling hook.
This allows you to reload any weapon you're using while grappling and to use the weapon's secondary fire functionality.

You can get some serious airtime and do some neat tricks if you're smart about giving yourself space to swing around and you attach the hook to high enough surfaces.
Have fun!
